# Introduction

Fermi Data Platforms (FDP) core mission is to host and serve curated data sets for the Genesis mission.
Initially we will host HEP (Treasure), accelerator and nuclear physics data on the FDP.
We are striving to move towards supporting a broader constituency within the DOE complex.



The Fermilab Data Platform, or FDP, provides secure, scalable access to high-value scientific data in support of the U.S. Department of Energy Genesis Mission and beyond.
Backed by decades of Fermilab leadership in large-scale, international physics experiments, FDP leverages proven expertise in managing and delivering complex research data.
Through its role in Genesis, Fermilab contributes technical and scientific expertise to projects exploring fundamental connections between the smallest building blocks of matter and the largest structures in the universe, helping advance AI-enabled science, discovery, and national leadership.
As an infrastructure partner for the Genesis Mission — a major initiative using artificial intelligence to transform scientific discovery — FDP enables researchers to access curated datasets locally and remotely through reliable, high-performance services. Data is available via streaming and file transfer using established tools such as XRootD, WebDAV, and Globus, supported by several petabytes of secure disk storage.
